== Etcd overview

Features of Etcd

* Distributed configuration
* Service registration and discovery

See the https://coreos.com/etcd/[overview] for more information.

== Spring Cloud Etcd Features

* Spring Etcd `DiscoveryClient` implementation
** supports Ribbon and Zuul
* Etcd based `PropertySource` loaded during the 'bootstrap' phase.

== Running the sample

1. https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases[Install etcd]
2. Run `./src/main/bash/run_etcd.sh`
3. verify etcd is running by visiting http://localhost:4001/version
4. run `mvn --settings .settings.xml package` this will bring in the required spring cloud maven repositories and build
5. run `java -jar spring-cloud-etcd-sample/target/spring-cloud-etcd-sample-1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar`
6. visit http://localhost:8080, verify that `{"serviceId":"<yourhost>:8080","host":"<yourhost>","port":8080}` results
7. run `java -jar spring-cloud-etcd-sample/target/spring-cloud-etcd-sample-1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar --server.port=8081`
8. visit http://localhost:8080 again, verify that `{"serviceId":"<yourhost>:8081","host":"<yourhost>","port":8081}` eventually shows up in the results in a round robbin fashion (may take a minute or so).
