{% capture billboard_description %}

Spring Cloud Etcd provides [Etcd](https://coreos.com/etcd/) integrations for Spring Boot apps through autoconfiguration and binding to the Spring Environment and other Spring programming model idioms. With a few simple annotations you can quickly enable and configure the common patterns inside your application and build large distributed systems with CoreOS Etcd. The patterns provided include Service Discovery and Distributed Configuration.

## Features

Spring Cloud Etcd features:

* Service Discovery: instances can be registered with Etcd and clients can discover the instances using Spring-managed beans
 * Supports Ribbon, the client side load-balancer via Spring Cloud Netflix
 * Supports Zuul, a dynamic router and filter via Spring Cloud Netflix
* Distributed Configuration: using the Etcd Key/Value store

## Quick Start

{% include download_widget.md %}

As long as Spring Cloud Etcd and the Etcd API are on the
classpath any Spring Boot application with `@EnableDiscoveryClient` will try to contact a Etcd
agent on `localhost:4001` (the default value of `spring.cloud.etcd.uris`):

```java
@Configuration
@EnableAutoConfiguration
@EnableDiscoveryClient
@RestController
public class Application {

  @RequestMapping("/")
  public String home() {
    return "Hello World";
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
  }

}
```

A local Etcd process must be running.  See the [Etcd documentation](https://coreos.com/etcd/docs/latest/) on how to run etcd.
